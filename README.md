# MUFG Insurance Knowledge Graph Visualization & Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project was developed for the **MUFG Hackathon** and focuses on building and visualizing an **Insurance Knowledge Graph**.  
The knowledge graph connects policies, claims, insurance types, product tiers, and other related entities to reveal patterns and relationships that are not immediately visible in tabular data.

The solution includes:
- An interactive **knowledge graph network** (`vis.js`) visualization of policies, claims, and related entities.
- Analytical workflows in a **Jupyter Notebook** (`MUFG_hackathon.ipynb`) for building and processing the graph.
- A demo **output video** showcasing the complete workflow and visualization.

This approach enables **data exploration, fraud detection, and relationship insights** in the insurance domain.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Notebook
The notebook covers:
- Data loading & preprocessing
- Building nodes and relationships for the knowledge graph
- Exporting graph data for visualization
- Generating the HTML-based interactive graph

Open `MUFG_hackathon.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab/Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook MUFG_hackathon.ipynb
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ View the Knowledge Graph
- Open `mufg_graph_sample200.html` in your browser to explore the graph.
- Or view it live here: **[Interactive Knowledge Graph on GitHub Pages](https://yourusername.github.io/mufg-insurance-graph/mufg_graph_sample200.html)**

## üé• Demo Video
- [Watch the Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LgUBeCdnRCZAoVZzL3m02vk7FoZLDrkN/view?usp=drive_link) 

<video src="https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/blob/main/MUFG%20GRAPH%20RECORDING%20200%20NODES.mp4?raw=true" controls></video>

The video walks through:
1. How the knowledge graph is built from insurance policy datasets.
2. How relationships between policyholders, claims, and products are visualized.
3. How insights can be extracted for decision-making.

## üìä Features
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Building interconnected nodes (Policies, Insurance Types, Product Tiers, States, Claims).
- **Interactive Visualization**: Zoom, pan, and click on nodes to view detailed policy and claim information.
- **Relationship Insights**: See how policies link to products, types, and statuses.
- **Risk Score Exploration**: Color-coded or size-based visual indicators for high-risk policies.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Enables easier detection of anomalies, trends, or possible fraudulent activities.

## üèÅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Knowledge Graphs** can transform complex insurance data into an interconnected network for actionable insights.  
By visualizing entities and relationships, it empowers better **risk assessment**, **fraud detection**, and **strategic planning**, with the flexibility to extend into predictive and real-time applications.
